### Main Feature Breakdown:
1. User Recipe Submission and Review Process: Your idea of having a review process for user-submitted recipes is great for quality control. Consider implementing a user-friendly submission form where users can input recipe details, including ingredients, instructions, and media (photos or videos). You can provide a confirmation message to users indicating that their recipe is under review.
2. Virtual Cookbooks and PDF Generation: The ability for users to create virtual cookbooks is a valuable feature. To format recipes like a cookbook, you can provide predefined templates or themes for users to choose from. Additionally, offering an option to generate PDF versions of the cookbooks would allow users to easily save, print, or share their collections.
3. Recipe Comparison: Allowing users to compare their uploaded recipes with existing ones from the Spoonacular API adds a useful feature. Consider providing a side-by-side comparison view, highlighting similarities and differences in ingredients, preparation methods, and nutrition information.
4. Recommendation Feature & Filtering: Incorporating a recommendation system based on user preferences, dietary restrictions, and other factors can enhance user engagement. Besides filtering options like calories and food type, you could also consider adding features like personalized recipe suggestions, trending recipes, or seasonal recommendations
5. Community Engagement and Reporting: To promote a healthy community, consider implementing features that encourage user interaction, such as comment sections for recipe discussions and sharing cooking tips. The Moderator role can handle user reports and ensure the platform maintains a respectful and constructive environment.
